# Emotion Explorer

**Emotion Explorer** is an interactive, educational web game designed to help children recognize and understand emotions through context-rich real-world situations.

Unlike traditional matching games that use emotion names or emojis, this project challenges children to match pairs of cards based solely on similar scenarios, promoting emotional intelligence and reading comprehension in a distraction-free environment.
